  {"id":"aboue-nzeImpactObstaclesDegree2009","abstract":"What is the impact of obstacles on the graphs of connections between stations in Mobile Ad hoc Networks? In order to answer, at least partially, this question, the first step is to define both an environment with obstacles and a mobility model for the stations in such an environment. The present paper focuses on a new way of considering the mobility within environments with obstacles, while keeping the core ideas of the well-known Random WayPoint mobility model (a.k.a RWP). Based on a mesh-partitioning of the space, we propose a new model called RSP-O-G for which we compute the spatial distribution of stations and analyse how the presence of obstacles impacts this distribution compared to the distribution when no obstacles are present. Coupled with a simple model of radio propagation, and according to the density of stations in the environment, we study the mean degree of the connection graphs corresponding to such mobile ad hoc networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Aboue-Nze","given":"C√©dric Ga√´l"},{"family":"Guinand","given":"Fr√©d√©ric"},{"family":"Pign√©","given":"Yoann"}],"citation-key":"aboue-nzeImpactObstaclesDegree2009","collection-title":"ICNS '09","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2009 Fifth International Conference on Networking and Services","DOI":"10.1109/ICNS.2009.36","event-place":"Valencia, Spain","event-title":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Networking and Services","ISBN":"978-0-7695-3586-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"332‚Äì337","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","publisher-place":"Valencia, Spain","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Impact of Obstacles on the Degree of Mobile Ad Hoc Connection Graphs","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"bridonneauAsymptoticDynamicGraph2024","abstract":"In this work, we investigate the analysis of generators for dynamic graphs, which are defined as graphs whose topology changes over time. We focus on generated graphs whose order (number of nodes) varies over time. We use a concept called ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù to qualify the long-term evolution of dynamic graphs. A dynamic graph is considered sustainable if its evolution does not result in a static, empty, or periodic graph. To illustrate how the analysis can be conducted, a parameterized and probability-based generator, named D3G3 (Degree-Driven Dynamic Geometric Graphs Generator), has been introduced in a recent work. From this model, we derive multiple scenarios that correspond to three trends in graph order evolution. Our central contribution lies in a mathematical framework that provides an expectation of the order of the graph at time step $$t+1$$, given its order at time step t. Nevertheless, our analysis underscores the challenge of characterizing the sustainability of dynamic graphs, even when a formal mathematical model for graph order evolution is known.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Bridonneau","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Guinand","given":"Fr√©d√©ric"},{"family":"Pign√©","given":"Yoann"}],"citation-key":"bridonneauAsymptoticDynamicGraph2024","container-title":"Applied Network Science","container-title-short":"Appl Netw Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s41109-024-00615-5","ISSN":"2364-8228","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"language":"en","page":"21","source":"Springer Link","title":"Asymptotic dynamic graph order evolution analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-024-00615-5","volume":"9"},

After a complex network analysis, the first approach proposes the analysis of sets of networks, called TG-Graphs, built from events occurring in constant-size sliding time windows. Time series represent the evolution of network measures, and the simultaneous analysis of these series for several measures highlights some phenomenons arising in the shipping network. In the second model, networks are modeled with temporal networks where each event is associated with a timestamp. In this model, distance-related measures take a new meaning since paths must obey time constraints. This approach reveals that although the global port network is highly connected, ports who are not directly connected to the main hubs are actually isolated from the rest of the network.","author":[{"family":"Guinand","given":"Fr√©d√©ric"},{"family":"Pign√©","given":"Yoann"}],"citation-key":"guinandTimeConsiderationsStudy2015","collection-title":"Routledge Studies in Transport Analysis","container-title":"Maritime Networks Spatial structures and time dynamics","edition":"C√©sar Ducruet","ISBN":"978-1-138-59930-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"english","page":"163‚Äì189","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Time considerations for the study of complex maritime networks","type":"chapter"},

Using real-time container ship positions provided by vessel tracking systems between 2015 and 2019, we study the impact of the privatization of the Greek port on its attractiveness and on that of competing ports for the ships of the various operators, and more particularly of COSCO. Difference-in-difference estimates suggest that the number of container ship calls to the Port of Piraeus has increased following its privatization, but that this increase in attractiveness corresponds mainly to vessels operated by COSCO with a capacity of more than 3000 twenty-foot equivalent units, and in particular to the largest of them. We do not identify any crowding out effect between operators in Piraeus: the use of Piraeus by the vessels of other operators remains relatively unchanged. The privatization of Piraeus seems to have imposed the Greek port as COSCO's transhipment hub for the European market without this being to the detriment of ports in any other particular European area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Koenig","given":"Pamina"},{"family":"Poncet","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Sanch-Maritan","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Duvallet","given":"Claude"},{"family":"Pign√©","given":"Yoann"}],"citation-key":"koenigSoldChinaContainer2024a","container-title":"Review of International Economics","DOI":"10.1111/roie.12675","ISSN":"1467-9396","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"¬© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","page":"510-544","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Sold to China: Container traffic in the Port of Piraeus","title-short":"Sold to China","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/roie.12675","volume":"32"},

Stochastic processes with probability density functions (pdf) of finite support define the dynamics. Structural and temporal faults are considered. Structural faults correspond to specific sequences of events that should satisfy precedence conditions defined with patterns. Temporal faults are defined with time constraints that must be fulfilled by the firing durations. The probabilities of consistent trajectories are computed with a numerical scheme from the collected timed measurements. The advantage of the proposed scheme is that it can be used for a large variety of pdf that may be defined either with an analytical or a numerical description. It works also for various time semantics. Diagnosis in terms of probability for faulty patterns and temporal constraints is established as a consequence.","author":[{"family":"Lefebvre","given":"Dimitri"},{"family":"Rachidi","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Leclercq","given":"Edouard"},{"family":"Pign√©","given":"Yoann"}],"citation-key":"lefebvreDiagnosisStructuralTemporal2018","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","container-title-short":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","DOI":"10.1109/TSMC.2018.2875726","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,9]]},"page":"1-13","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Diagnosis of Structural and Temporal Faults for k-Bounded Non-Markovian Stochastic Petri Nets","type":"article-journal","volume":"PP"},

The proposed method is an automatic approach based on the feedback of prediction errors at each time slot without the needs of external intervention.

Network analysis (NA) can offer a broad framework of indicators to tackle this problem. In this article, we present a detailed analysis of a life cycle inventory (LCI) model from an NA perspective. Specifically, the network is represented as a directed graph and the ‚Äúemergy‚Äù numeraire is used as the weight associated with the arcs of the network. The case study of a technological system for drinking water production is presented. We investigate the topological and structural characteristics of the network representation of this system and compare properties of its weighted and unweighted network, as well as the importance of nodes (i.e., life cycle unit processes). By identifying a number of advantages and limitations linked to the modeling complexity of such emergy-LCI networks, we classify the LCI technosphere network of our case study as a complex network belonging to the scale-free network family. The salient feature of this network family is represented by the presence of ‚Äúhubs‚Äù: nodes that connect with many other nodes. Hub failures may imply relevant changes, decreases, or even breaks in the connectedness with other smaller hubs and nodes of the network. Hence, by identifying node centralities, we can rank and interpret the relevance of each node for its special role in the life cycle network.","author":[{"family":"Navarrete Guti√©rrez","given":"Tom√°s"},{"family":"Rugani","given":"Benedetto"},{"family":"Pign√©","given":"Yoann"},{"family":"Marvuglia","given":"Antonino"},{"family":"Benetto","given":"Enrico"}],"citation-key":"navarretegutierrezComplexityLifeCycle2016","container-title":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","container-title-short":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/jiec.12338","ISSN":"1530-9290","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1094-1107","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"On the Complexity of Life Cycle Inventory Networks: Role of Life Cycle Processes with Network Analysis","title-short":"On the Complexity of Life Cycle Inventory Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12338/abstract","volume":"20"},

It relies on two freely available sources of real information for the country of Luxembourg. The first source is traffic data collected by counting devices located on the Luxembourgian road network, while the second is geographical information about different types of areas: residential, industrial, commercial and other services. VehILux models vehicles commuting around the city of Luxembourg by considering two types of traffic, outer traffic with vehicles entering in the defined geographical area and inner traffic starting from residential zones located inside the geographical area. One part of the collected traffic data is used as input traffic, while another part is used to control the produced traffic and to fine-tune the model.

  {"id":"saadaNewSelectionStrategies2017","abstract":"Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks are used in many dangerous applications. When performing their tasks, actors may fail due to harsh environments in which they are deployed. Some actors are cut-vertices within network. Their loss breaks its connectivity and disrupts its operation accordingly. Therefore, restoring network connectivity is crucial. DARA is among the most popular connectivity restoration schemes. It performs multi-actor relocations in order to replace a failed cut-vertex by one of its neighbors, based on the lowest degree. In this paper, we propose new selection strategies of actor‚Äôs substitute in DARA, in which the substitute selection is based on the nature of the links with neighbors rather than on the degree. Our approaches improve the performance of DARA by reducing the number of relocated actors in the recovery process by 24% on average compared to its original selection strategy. The proposed strategies are validated through simulation experiments.","author":[{"family":"Saada","given":"Riadh"},{"family":"Pign√©","given":"Yoann"},{"family":"Olivier","given":"Damien"}],"citation-key":"saadaNewSelectionStrategies2017","collection-title":"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering","container-title":"Ad Hoc Networks","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-51204-4_4","editor":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yifeng"},{"family":"Kunz","given":"Thomas"}],"event-place":"Ottawa, Canada","event-title":"8th International Conference, ADHOCNETS 2016","ISBN":"978-3-319-51204-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"38-49","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Ottawa, Canada","source":"Springer Link","title":"New Selection Strategies of Actor‚Äôs Substitute in DARA for Connectivity Restoration in WSANs","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"shimakoEnvironmentalAssessmentBioenergy2016","abstract":"Microalgae have been studied as a potential alternative raw material and various technologies have been proposed to transform the algal biomass into energy products. In this study, two bioenergy production systems of very different complexities were modelled to assess their environmental efficiencies: a biodiesel system and a biogas system. Biodiesel system used supercritical extraction and transesterification as key processes; to the best of authors' knowledge, there is no previous work analysing the environmental performances of such production system. Cumulative energy demand, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and dynamic LCA for climate change were used to evaluate the environmental footprint of the production systems. Conventional systems for electricity, heat and diesel production were considered for comparison. Energy balance showed that the supercritical extraction and drying steps were the most energy consuming unit operations in biodiesel production and further developments of technologies might be envisaged. LCA showed that climate change was the main contributor to impacts on human health and ecosystem quality due to energy consumed in production steps. Also, heat from biogas was the only product that proved to have a satisfactory environmental performance with regard to other conventional production systems. Finally, dynamic climate change evaluation (used for the first time for bio-chemical processes) revealed no carbon sequestration in microalgae system.","author":[{"family":"Shimako","given":"Allan Hayato"},{"family":"Tiruta-Barna","given":"Ligia"},{"family":"Pign√©","given":"Yoann"},{"family":"Benetto","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Navarrete Guti√©rrez","given":"Tom√°s"},{"family":"Guiraud","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Ahmadi","given":"Aras"}],"citation-key":"shimakoEnvironmentalAssessmentBioenergy2016","container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.08.003","ISSN":"0959-6526","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"page":"51‚Äì60","title":"Environmental assessment of bioenergy production from microalgae based systems","type":"article-journal","volume":"139"},
  {"id":"tiruta-barnaFrameworkComputationalTool2016","abstract":"Conventional Life Cycle Inventories (LCIs) are static models of product systems without time dependent functioning of plants and time lags between supply and demand of products. The aggregation of environmental interventions without consideration of the time dimension represents an acknowledged limitation of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. In this paper we present a novel conceptual and computational framework for the consideration of time dependency in LCIs. Process modeling is used to describe the production flows and environmental interventions of each unit process and supply modeling is used to include time lags on the raw materials exchanged by unit processes of the product system. The combination of production and supply models in life cycle networks, based on a set of specific temporal parameters (representative functioning period, production time, supply delay, supply frequency), allows the characterization of time dependency in each node. For the computation of time dependent LCI, i.e. of the time resolved environmental interventions, graph search algorithm is proposed and implemented in a prototype Web application. In terms of results, the new approach provides time dependent LCI expressed as: i) time as a function of individual emission (or resource consumption) for individual processes, ii) aggregated time as a function of a given environmental intervention. A test bed case illustrating the effectiveness of the conceptual and computational approaches (proof of concept) is presented and successfully solved both analytically and numerically.","author":[{"family":"Tiruta-Barna","given":"Ligia"},{"family":"Pign√©","given":"Yoann"},{"family":"Navarrete Guti√©rrez","given":"Tom√°s"},{"family":"Benetto","given":"Enrico"}],"citation-key":"tiruta-barnaFrameworkComputationalTool2016","container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","container-title-short":"Journal of Cleaner Production","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.12.049","ISSN":"0959-6526","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,10]]},"page":"198-206","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Framework and computational tool for the consideration of time dependency in Life Cycle Inventory: proof of concept","title-short":"Framework and computational tool for the consideration of time dependency in Life Cycle Inventory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652615018739","volume":"116"},
